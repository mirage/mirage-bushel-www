It's important to consider the process of disclosing issues to us. Many bugs can be reported as usual on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues), but public forums are sometimes inappropriate for reporting security issues.  If you think you've discovered a security vulnerability, the best way to inform us is to send us an email to **security [at] mirage.io**. One of the team will respond and we will take it from there.

A OpenPGP key is available from the keyservers, with fingerprint `23B2 822C 89A9 EC73 C7DF 0748 4A73 2D75 7C0E DA74`.
