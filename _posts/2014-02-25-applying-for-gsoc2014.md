MirageOS will part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) 2014
program, thanks to the Xen Project's participation!  It's been a few years
since I've mentored for GSoc, but I still have fond memories of some great
projects in the past (such as the legendary [Quake testing](http://vmgl.sourceforge.net/)
we were forced to do for hours on end).  I've already received a number of
queries about this year's program from potential students, so here's a few
things to note to become a successful applicant.

* Students still need to apply and be accepted. Your chances of being
  selected are much higher if you demonstrate some participation and
  code contributions (even minor) *before* submitting an application.
  Thus, even if you don't have a copy of Xen around, roll up your sleeves
  and head over to the [installation instructions](http://openmirage.org/wiki/install).

* Contributions do not have to be just code.  They can be documentation,
  help with packaging, wiki posts about a particular use, or test cases
  to improve code coverage.

* It's unlikely that we'll get students who are very familiar with both
  OCaml and Xen (if you are, definitely get in touch with us!).  You should
  therefore look over the [project ideas](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/GSoc_2014#Mirage_OS)
  as a set of guidelines and not firm suggestions.  If you have a particular
  thing you'd like to do with Mirage (for example, work on the JavaScript
  backend, an [IPython interface](https://github.com/andrewray/iocamljs) or
  a particular protocol implementation such as XMPP, then that's fine.  Just
  get in touch with us on the [mailing lists](/community) or directly via
  e-mail, and we can work through them.

* Under some circumstances, we can provide resources such as a login to
  a Xen machine, or delegated credits on a cloud provider.  Don't let that
  stop you from applying for a project idea.  In general though, it's best
  to only depend on your own computer resources if practical to do so.
